# What the food?

A small demo web app, build with backbone.js and (a little) HTML5.

Main purpose of this app was (and is) to learn backbone.js and the more advanded techniques of JavaScript. 

The other purpose is to have a small list of meals, their ingredients and a day of the week where this dinner is planned. I use such a list often to keep track of the food I have bought and for what meal it was intended. I mix this stuff up a lot...

This app is not that much different than the Todos app listed in the examples section of backbone.js. So don't expect anything new and ground breaking.

## libs dir
The lib/ directory includes all the needed external JavaScript libraries. For development, I just like to have these around in an non-minimized fashion.

## Other things used:

- Sass
- Mustache.js
- JQuery
